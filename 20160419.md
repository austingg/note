# New Paper
1. Deep Residual Networks with Exponential Linear Unit
In this paper, we propse the use of exponential linear unit instead of the combination of ReLu and Batch Normalization in Residual Networks. 
2. We show taht this not only speeds up learning in Residual Networks but also improves the accuracy as the depth increases.
3. The vanishing gradient problem is trivial in very deep networks. During the backpropagation phase, the gradietns are computed by the chain rule. Multiplication of small numbers int he chain rule leads to an exponetial decrease in the gradient.
4. In our model, F consists of a sequence of layers: Conv-ELU-Conv-BN. Also we do not add any other activation function after addition with identity mapping.
5.conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we imporve beyond the current state-of-the-art in terms of test error, while also learning faster than these models using ELUs. ELUs push the mean activations towards zero as they introduce small negative values, this reduces the bias shift and  increases the learning speed. 

# Pimpl idiom
1. The pimpl idiom is a modern C++ technique to hide implementation, to minimize coupling, and to separate interfaces. Pimpl is short for "pointer to implementation." You may already be familiar with the concept but know it by other names like Cheshire Cat or Compiler Firewall idiom.
2. Here' s how the pimpl idiom can improve the software development lifecycle:
    * Minimization of compilation dependencies.
    * Separation of interface and implementation.
    * Portability.
 3. The pimpl idiom avoids rebuild cascades and bittle object layouts. It's well suited for popular types.
 
 # Smart pointers
 1. In modern C++ programming, the Standard library includes smart pointer, which are used to help ensure that programs are free of memory and resource leaks and are exception-safe.
 2. Smart pointers are defined in the std namespace in the <memory> header file. They are crucial to the RAII or Resource Acquisition Is Initialization programming idiom. The main goal of this idiom is to ensure that resource acquisition occures at the same time that the object is initialized, so that all resources for the object are created and made ready in one line of code. IN practical terms , the main principle of RAII is to give ownership of any heap-allocated resource - for example, dynamically-allocated memeory or system object handles - to a stack-allocated object whose destructor contains the code to delete for free the resource and also any associated cleanup code. 
 3. In most cases, when you initialize a raw pointer or resource handle to point to an actual resouce, pass the pointer to a smart pointer immediately. In modern C++, raw pointers are only used in small code blocks of limited scope, loops, or helper funcitons where performance is critical and there is no chance of confusion about ownship.
 4. A smart pointer is a class template that you declare on the stack, and intialize by using a raw pointer that points to a heap-allocated object. After the smart pointer is intialized, it owns the raw pointer. This mean sthat the smart pointer is responsible for deleteing the memory that the raw pointer specifies. The smart pointer destructor contains the call to delete, and because the smart pointer is declared on the stack, its destructor is invoke when the smart pointer goes out of scope, even if an exception is thrown somewhere further up the stack.
 5. C++ Standard Library Smart Pointers
    * unique_prt: Allows exactly one owner of the underlying pointer. Use as the default choice for POCO (plain old C++ objects) unless you know for certain that you require a shared_ptr, Can be moved to a new owner, but not copied or shared. Replaces auto_ptr, which is deprecated. Compared to boost:scoped_ptr, unique_prt is small and efficient; 
    * shared_ptr, reference-counted smart pointer. Use when you want to assign one raw pointer to multiple owner, for example, when you return a copy of a pointer from a container but want to keep the original. The raw pointer is not deleted until all shared_ptr owners have gone out of scope or have otherwise given up owership. The size is two pinters; one for the object and one for the shared control block that contains the reference count. Header file: <memory>. 
    * weak_ptr: Special-case smart pinter for use in conjunction with shared_ptr. A weak_ptr provides access to an object that is owned by one or more shared_ptr instances, but does not participate in reference counting. Use when you want to observe an object, but do not require it to remain alive.
 6. Pass shared_ptr to another function
    * Pass the shared_ptr by value. this invokes the copy constructor, increments the reference count, and makes the callee an owner.
    * Pass the shared_ptr by reference or const reference. In this case, the reference count is not incremented, and the callee can access the pointer as long as the caller does not go out of scope.
    
 # Algorithms (Modern C++)
 1. For modern C++ programming, we recommend that you use the algorithms in the standard Template (STL). Here are some important examples:
    * for_each, which is the default traversal algorithm. (Also transform for not in palce semantics)
    * find_if, which is the defual search algorithm
    * sort, lower_bound, and the ohter default sorting and searching algorithms.
 2. To write a comparator, use strict < and use named lambdas when you can.
 auto comp = [](const widget& w1, const widget& w2)
            { return w1.weight() < w2.weight(); }
 sort(v.begin(), v.end(), comp);
 3. When possible, use range-based for loops or algorithm calls, or both, instead of hand-written loops. copy, transform, count_if, remove_if, and others like them are much better than handwritten loops beacuse their intent is obvious and they make it easier to write bug-free code. Also, many STL algorithms have implementation optimizations that make them more efficient.
 
 # Random Numbers
 In modern C++, you don't have to deal with those shortcomings - nor do you have to invent your own uniformly distributed random number generator - because the tools for quickly and easily creating them are available in the STL, as shown in <random>. (Since C++ 11)
 
 # Uniform Initialization and Delegating Constructors
 In modern C++, you can use brace initialization for any type, without the equals sign. Also, you can use delegating contructors to simplify your code when you have multiple constructors that perform similar work.
 
 You can use brace intialization anywhere you would typically do initialization -- for example, as a function parameter or a return value, or with new keyward;
 
 return {4.5};
 
 # Intializer_list 
 The standard library container classes, and string, wstring, and regex, have  initializer_list constructors.
 
 # Object lifetime and resource management (Modern C++)
 1. In C++, resouce management is directly related to object lifetime.
 2. An importtatn thing in object-lifetime management is the encapsulation -- whoever's using an object doesn't have to know what resources that object owns, or how to get rid of them, or even whether it owns any resources at all. It just has to destroy the object. The C++ core language is designed to ensure that objects are destroyed at the correct times, that is as blocks are exited, in reverse order of construction.
 3. Another important concept in lifetime managment: destructors. Destructors encapsulate resource release. A resource is something that you get from "the system" and have to give back later. Memroy is the most common resource, but there are also files, sockets, textures, and other non-memory resources. "Owning" a resource means you can use it when you need it but you also have to release it when you're finished with it. When an object is destoryed, its destructor releases the resources that it owned.
 4. In modern C++, stack-based scope is a powerful way to write robust code because it combines automatic stack lifetime and data memeber lifetime with high efficiency -- lifetime tracking is essentially free of over head. Heap object lifetime requires diligent manual management and can be the source of resource leaks and inefficiencies, especially when you are working with raw pointers. 
 
 # Welcom back to C++ (Modern C++)
 C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient. The language is more flexible than other languages because you can use it to create a wide range of apps -- from fun and exciting games, to high-performance scientific software, to device drivers, embedded programs, and Windows client apps. For more than 20 years, C++ has been used to solve problems like these and many others. What you might not know is that an increasing number of C++ number programmers have folded up the dowdy C-style programming of yesterday and have donned modern C++ instead.
 
 In modern C++, you don't have to use new/delete or explicit exception handling because you can use smart pointer instead. When you use the auto type deduction and lambda funciton, you can wirte code quicker, tighten it, and understand it better. And for_each is cleaner, easier to use, and less prone to unintened erros than a for loop. You can use biolerplate together with minimal lines of code to write your app. And you can make the code exception-safe and memory-safe, and have no allocaiton/deallocation or error codes to deal with.
 
 Modern C++ incorporates two kinds of polymorphism: compile-time, through templates, and run-time, through inheritance and virtualization. You can mix the two kinds of polymorphism to great effect. The STL template shared_ptr uses internal vitual methods to accomplish its apparently effortless type erasure. But don't over-use virtualization for polymorhism when a template is the better choice. Template can be very powerful.
