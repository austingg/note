# Git tutorial
1. The whole idea behind any version control system is to store "safe" copies of a project so that you never have to worry about irreparably breaking your code base. Once you've built up a project history, git checkout is an easy way to "load" any of these saved snapshots onto your development machine.
2. checking out an old commit is a read-only operation. It's impossible to harm your repository while viewing an old revision. The "current" state of your project remains untouched in the master branch.
3. The git revert command undoes a committed snapshot. But, instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to undo the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting content. This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.
4. It's important to understand that git revert undoes a single commit - it does not "revert" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. In Git, this is actually called reset, not a revert.
5. If git revert is a "safe" way to undo changes, you can think of git reset as the dangerous method. When you undo with git reset, there is no way to retrieve the origianl copy ---- it is a permanet undo.
6. Whereas reverting is designed to safely undo a public commit, git reset is designed to undo local changes. Because of theire distinct goals, the two commands are implemented differently: resetting completely removes a changeset, whereas reverting maintains the original changeset and uses a new commit to apply the undo.
7. The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the master branch has progressed since you started working on a feature. Rebasing is a common way to integrate upstream changes into your local repository.
8. The `git remote` command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL. Instead of referencing them by their full URLs, you can pass the origin and john shortcuts to other Git commands. When you clone a repository with git clone, it automatically creates a remote connection called origin pointing back to the cloned repository. This is useful for developers creating a local copy of a central repository, since it provides an easy way to pull upstream changes or publish local commits.
9. git pull is an easy way to synchronize your local repository with upstream changes.
10. The most common use case for git push is to publish your local changes to a central repository. After  you've accumulated several local commits and are ready to share them with the rest of the team.
11. The pull request is more than just a notification ---- it's a dedicated forum for discussing the proposed feature. If  there are any problems with the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull request and even tweak the feature by pushing follow-up commits.

### Branches
1. git checkout can be used to select a branch. 
2. As you read, remeber that Git branches aren't like SVN branches. Where SVN branches are only used to capture the occasional large-scale development effort, Git branches are an integral part of your everyday workflow.
3. By developing them in branches, it's not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keep the main master branch free from questionable code.
4. git branch,    git branch -d,    git branch -D
5. The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Think of it as a way to select which line of development you're working on.
6. Once you've finished developing a feature in an isolated branch. It's important to be able to get it back into the main code base. 

``` Shell
git checkout -b new-feature master
git add
git commit -m "Start a feature"
git add
git commit -m "Finish a feature"
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
```


# Paper reading: Hardware-Oriented Approximation of convolutional neural networks
1. One of the most important steps in accelerator development is hardware-oriented model approximation. In this paper we present Ristretto, a model approximation framework that analyzes a given CNN with respect to numerical resolution used in representing weights and outputs of convolutional and fully connected layers.
2. Ristretto cancondense models by using fixed point arithmetic and representation instead of floating point. Fixed point arithmetic is less resource hungry compared to floating point. Using fixed point arithmetic is a hardware-friendly way of approximating CNNs. It allows the use of smaller processing elements and reduces the memory requirements without adding any computational overhead such as decompression.
3. The code is available. [link](https://github.com/pmgyesl/caffe)
4. The different parts of a CNN have a significant dynamic range. In large layers, the outputs are the result of thousands of accumulations, thus the network parameters are much smaller than the layer outputs.
5. Ristretto takes a trained model as input, and automatically brews a condense network version. Input and output of Ristretoo are a network description file prototxt and the network parameters.Optionally, the quantized network can be fine-tuned with Ristretto. The resulting fixed point model in Caffe-format can then be used for a hardware accelerator.
6. We can conclude that dynamic fixed point performs significantly better for such a large network.
7. The SqueezeNet architecture was developed by Iandola with the goal of a small CNN that performs well on the ImageNet data set. Ristretto can make the already small network even smaller, so that its parameter size is less than 2MB. This condensed network is well-suited for deployment in smart mobile systems.
8. Ristretto is in its first development stage.
