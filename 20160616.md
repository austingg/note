### The difference between photography and most other art forms
1. if you paint an apple, no mater what you do, you're not going to paint it exactly the same; even is you try. And you're probably goint to paint the idealised idea of an apple, not an apple itself. It is a representation of what the artist believes that object should look like, the sum of his or her expectations. Not the object itself.
2. Waht the photographer sees is what the camera sees. In a painting, it must first pass through the eyes of the artist, the interpretation of their brain and motor skills, and then only to canvas or sculpture or whatever media happens to be their choice.
3. Recognizability of the subjects within a photograph drives perception of the audience: it looks like the subject, therefore it is. It is not always recognised as being an artist's interpretation - perhaps that is the fault of the artist for failing to see their own vision in the subject or scene, or perhaps it is their lack of technical chos in the execution. Whatever the case may be, few photographs are mistaken for anything but photographs. This has two consequences on the art itself: firstly, the perception of an image that is not instantly indentiable as a photograph may confuse the audience, but it may just as likely surprise and engage them for its difference.
