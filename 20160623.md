==========
### Caffe
1. support copylayer from multiple pretrained model

### Linux Command
1. sed -i '1,3d' file.txt


### Caffe Makefile 
1. find src/$(PROJECT) ! -name "test_*.cpp" -name "*.cpp"
2. $(shell find src/$(PROJECT) ! -name "test_*.cu -name "*.cu")


### Makefile
1. -f filename: specify makefile
2. -p print
3. -n only print not execute


<target> : <dependency>
   rule: describe how to generate target using dependencies

rule: one or many command, command begin with TAB

$: reserved word, $$
\: multiline

= recursive assign
:= directe unfold assign
?= conditional assign
+= append 

$@ : target name in the rule
$< : dependency
$+ : all dependencies
$* target name without extension

cc: c compiler
CFLAGS:
CXX: c plus plus compiler



objdump
nm: list symbols from object files
ar: cre, modify, and extract from archives
ld: linker

label: xxx xxx xxx

make GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

**xargs**

### English
1. Crash course


### Python library
1. Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.
2. It aims to be the fudamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.
3. __main__ : make a script both importable and executable


### caffe, mxnet symbol 
1. forward use to generate lib

### MxNet cpu slower than caffe
1. Only reshapes when shapes change helps a lot
2. Specifically for convolutional networks on Haswell or above Intel CPUs at reasonable batch size (> 32 or so)
3. Using NNPACK helps a lot (Caffe has pull request for example integration)
4. Tuning OMP_NUM_THREADS and OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS can make much difference. According to our experiments setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to the number of cores of a single CPU performs best. The difference can be more than 2X
5. NNPACK seems interesting. Intel has been working on similar things in MKL. It is said that a DNN-optimized MKL version will be released at Q4 this year.

### Valgrind
1. Memcheck tool in Unix
2. Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysisi tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.


### python coverage
1. python library for code coverage


### TODO
1. Reorgnize CMake and Make related resource
2. Unix C++ programming
3. Python standard library


### C++ engineering 
1. strip the symbols
   in executable programs with a main() you can remove all unneeded functions during compilation
   * C_FLAGS += -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
   * LD_FLAGS += --gc-sections
2. In practice
   Make the symbols you definitely need visible and the rest hidden
   
3. Symbols are useful for the linker to decide if different modules(objects files, dynamic shared libraries, executables) would share same data or code. However, it is rare that people make variables shared among shared libraries and executables. And for such module, it is very common to make only functions visible to the others. Sometimes we call such functions API as the module is deemed to provide such interfaces for other to call into. We also say such symbols are exported since it is visible to the others. Notices that such visibility only takes effect at dynamci linking time since shared libraries are commonly loaded as part of memory image at program runs. Therefore, symbol visibility comes to be an attribute for all global symbols for dynamic linking.


### binutils: a collection of binary tools.
1. as, ld, gprof, ar
2. addr2line, nm, readelf, strip
3. objcopy, objdump 


### C Preprocessor
include library file  #include <filename>
include user file     #include "filename"
replacement text   #define name text
replacement macro  #define name(var) text

quoted string in replace    #
concatenate args and rescan   ##

conditional exection   #if #else #elif #endif #ifdef

line continuation char  \


### python library
1. six: is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both versions. 
2. yield: any generator is an iterator
