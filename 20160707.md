### Bloom filter
1. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilitic data structure, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negative are not, thus a Bloom filter has a 100% recall rate. In other words, a query returns either possibly in set or definitely not in set.


### Travis CI(continuous Integration)
Test and Deploy with confidence
1. Easily sync your GitHub projects with Travis CI and you'll be testing your code in minutes
2. Pull request build flow
    * a pull request is created

    * Your build passes
    * Travis CI updates the PR that is passed
    * you merge in the Pr goodness
3. Travis CI vs. jenkins
