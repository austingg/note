### GitHub tutorial

* GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects form anywhere.

* A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets-anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

* Braching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master. When you create a branch off the master branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
* On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other comtributors can understand what you've done and why.
*  Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pullrequest, you're proposing your changes and requesting that some one review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.

#### Results
The actual speedup could depend on the hardware and software implemntation. Below are the results tested on a Titan Black with cuda-7.5 and cudnn-v4. The batch size is set to 256 for CaffeNet, and 32 for VGG16. The Average Forward-Backward time per minibatch is reported.

|           |Top-5 ACC.(%)|Time(ms)/iter|Actual Speedup|
|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
|CaffeNet   |    80.03    |      668    |        -     |
|CaffeNet-lr|    79.66    |      307    |      2.28x   |
|VGG16      |    90.60    |     1570    |        -     |
|VGG16-lr   |    90.31    |      759    |      2.07x   |
