# Defocus
1. In optics, defocus is the abeeration in which an image is simply out of focus. optically, defocus refers to a translation along the optical axis away from the plane or surface of best focus. In general defocus reduces the sharpness and constrast of the image. What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene. Nearly all image-forming optical devices incorporate some form of focus adjustment to minimize defocus and maximize image quality.

# Motion Blur
1. Motion blur is the apparent streaking of rapidly moving objects in a still image or a sequence of images such as movie or animation. It results when the image being recorded changes during the recording of a single exposure, either due to rapid movement or long exposure.
2. When a camera creates an image, that image does not represnet a single instant of time. Because of technological constraints or artistic requirements, the image may represent the scene over a period of time. Most often this exposure time is brief enough that the image captured by the camera appears to captures an instantaneous moment, but this is not always so, and a fast moving object or a longer exposure time may result in blurring artifacts which make this apparent.
3. 图像虚： 物动虚， 镜动虚， 云虚，雾虚，尘虚，风虚。
4. When we apply the motion blurring effect, it will look like you captured the picture while moving in a particular direction. 

# opencv with python by example

### motion blur
``` python
import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv.imread('input.png')
cv2.imshow('Original', img)

size = 15

# generating the kernel
kernel_motion_blur = np.zeros((size, size))
kernel_motion_blur[int((size-1)/2), :] = np.ones(size)
kernel_motion_blur = kernel_motion_blur/size

# applying the kernel to the input image

output = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel_motion_blur)

cv2.imshow('Motion Blur', output)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

### image warp

``` python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import math

img = cv2.imread('images/input.jpg', cv2.IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)
rows, cols = img.shape

# Vertical wave

img_output = np.zeros(img, shape, dtype=img.dtype)

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        offset_x = int(25.0 * math.sin(2*3.14*i/180))
        offset_y = 0
        if j+offset_x < rows:
            img_output[i, j] = img[i, (j+offset_x)%cols]
        else :
            img_output[i, j] = 0
cv2.imshow('Input', img)
cv2.imshow('Vertical wave', img_output)

```

# python standard library
1. multiprocessing 
2. args, kwargs, positional argument, keyword argument named argument
3. numpy also has a few shortcuts well-suited to dealinig with arrays with an interminate number of dimensions. 
    * Ellipsis object: indicates "as many" : as needed. This makes it easy to manipulate only on dimension of an array, letting numpy do array-wise operations over the unwanted dimensions.  
    * indexing with tuples
    * np.where
4. one of the selling points of numpy is the ability to do operations "array-wse":
    * 2*A
    * The general syntax for a slice is array[start:stop:step]
    * A[::-1]
5. " ".join 

# Scrapy images with Python and Scrapy
1. image acquistion is one of the most under-talked about subjects in the computer vision field!

``` shell
scrapy startproject timecoverspider
```
items.py, setting.py, coverspider.py inside the spiders directory.


# Programming
1. ccmake for inteface cmake


# triplet loss github python



# ROC 
1. in statistics, a receiver operating charateristic (ROC) is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by ploting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate FRP at various threshold settings.
