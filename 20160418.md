1. Hardware-oriented approximation of convolutional neural networks
    * Reistretto can condense models by using fixed point arithmetic and representation instead of floating point.
    * In this paper, we concentrate on approximating convolutional and fully connected layers only. Using fixed point arithmetic is a hardware-friendly way of approximating CNNs. It allows the use of smaller processing elements and reduces the memory requirements without adding any computational overhead such as decompression.
    * We present Ristretto, which automatically finds a perfect balance between the bit-width reduction and the given maximum error tolerance. Ristretto performs a fast and fully automated trimming analysis of any given network. This post-training tool can be used for application-specific trimming of neural networks.
