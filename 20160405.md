### Well-posed problem
The matchmatical term well-posed problem stems from a definition given by Jacques Hadamard. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that
* A solution exists
* The solution is unique
* The solution's behavior changes continously with the initial conditions.

Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed ill-posed. Inverse problems are often ill-posed. 

Continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While soluitons may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions, they may suffer from numerical instatility when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problems is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers. 

If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a stable algorithm. If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smootheness of solution. This process is knowns as regularization.


### Condition Number
$$cond(A) = ||A|| * ||A^-1||$$


### Paper Reading ---- Non-Photorealistic Rendering of Portraits
We describe an image-based non-photorealistic rendering pipeline for creating portraits in two styles: The first is somewhat "puppet" like rendering and the second style is inspired by the artist Julian Opie, in which the human face is reduced to its essentials, i.e. homogeneous skin, thick black lines, and facial features such as eyes and the nose represented in a cartoon manner. 

The most common such application is to faces(i.e. the generation of NPR portraits).

CLM: Fitting is preceded by initialisation using a standard face detector. The authors code is available with pre-trained facial models, and is efficient, with a run time around 2 seconds for a 0.5 megapixel image.

The second step in our NPR pipeline is to re-render the skin regions. Ideally the skin would be provided by the facial model. Ideally the skin would be provided by the facial model, but even though we are using a state of the art face detector with some subsequent refinement, the results are inadequate since facie model is incomplete, coarse and inaccurate.
