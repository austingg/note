### Well-posed problem
The matchmatical term well-posed problem stems from a definition given by Jacques Hadamard. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that
* A solution exists
* The solution is unique
* The solution's behavior changes continously with the initial conditions.

Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed ill-posed. Inverse problems are often ill-posed. 

Continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While soluitons may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions, they may suffer from numerical instatility when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problems is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers. 

If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a stable algorithm. If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smootheness of solution. This process is knowns as regularization.
