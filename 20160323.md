### Image warping
Image warping is the process of digitally manipulating an image such that any shapes portrayed in the image have been significantly distored. Warping may be used for correcting image distortion as well as for creative purposes.
* While an image can be transformed in various ways, pure warping means that points mapped to points without changing the colors. This can be based mathematically on any function fomr(part of ) the plane to the plane. If the function is injective the original can be reconstructed. If the function is a bijection any image can be inversely transformed.
* The following list is not meant to be partitioning of all available methods into categories.
  - Image may be distorted through simulation of optical aberrations.
  - Image may be viewed as if they had been projected onto a curved or mirrored surface.
  - Image can be partitioned into polygons and each polygons distorted.
  - Image can be distorted using morphing.
* There are at least two ways to generate an image using whatever chosen methods to distort.
  - (forward-mapping) a given mapping from sources to images is directly applied
  - (reverse-mapping) for given mapping from sources to image, the source is found from the image.
* How do we specify where every pixels goes? (mapping)
* How do we compute colors at dest pixels? (resampling)


### Morphing
Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shape into another through a seamless transition.
