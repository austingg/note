1. cost 7~8 days using 6 K80s
2. maybe some bug in im2rec

# Matplotlib
1. plt.gcf(), plt.gca()
2. ax.set_xlable('time') 
    * set_xlim([xmin, xmax])
    * set_xticks()
    * ax.xaxis.set_major_locator()
    * ax.xaxis.set_min_locator()
    * ax.xaxis.grid(True, which='major') 

# Blur detection with OpenCV
1. If there are a low amount of high frequencies, then the image can be considered blurry. However, defining what is a low number of high frequencies and what is a high number of high frequencies can be quite probmatic, often leading to sub-par results.
2. vairation of the Laplacian by 2000 ICPR paper. diatom autofocusing in brightfield microscopy: a comparative study. This method is simple. Straghtforward. Has sound reasoning. And can be implemented in only a single line of code.
``` python
cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F).var()
```
3. If the variance falls below a pre-defined threshold, then the image is consider blurry; otherwise, the image is not blurry.
4. Obviously the trick here is setting the correct threshold which can be quite domain dependent. Too low of a threshold and you'll incorrectly mark images as blurry when they are not.
5. This value is quite subjective to the contents of the images, so you'll need to play with this value yourself to obtain optimal results.
6. We implemented the variance of Laplacian method to give us a single floating point value to represent the "blurryness" of an image. This method is fast, simple  and easy to apply -- we simply convolve our input image with the Laplacian operator and compute the vairation. If the variance falls below a predefined threshold, we mark the image as "blurry". It's important to note that threshold is a critical parameter to tune correctly and you'll often need to tune it on a per-dataset basis.
