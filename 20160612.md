### Recognizing Image Style
1. We find that features learned in a multi-layer network generally perform best-even when trained with object class (not style) labels. We use the learned classifiers to extend traditional tag-based image search to extend traditinal tag-based image search to sonsider stylistic constrinets.
2. Flickr dataset: 80K 20 style labels.
3. While understanding style is crucial to image understanding, very little research in computer vision has explored visual style.
4. Although is it very recognizable to human observers, visual style is a difficult concept to rigorously define.
5. we find that deep convolutional neural network features perform best for the task.
6. This leads to one conclusion of our work: mid-level features derived from object datasets are generic for style recognition and superior to hand-tuned features.
7. One of the most interesting outcomes of this work is the success of features trained for object detection for both aesthetic and style classification.

## DataSet
1. `Flickr` 80K image covering 20 styles
  - photographic techniques
  - genres (vintage, Romantic, Horror)
  - types of style scenes ("Haze", "Sunny")
  These styles are `not mutually exclusive` and represent different attributes of style.
  
  * Optical techniques: Macro, Bokeh, Depth-of-Field, Long Exposure, HDR
  * Atmosphere: Hazy, Sunny
  * Mood: Serene, Melancholy, Ethereal
  * Composition styles: Minimal, Geometric, Detailed, Texture
  * Color: Pastel, Bright
  * Genre: Noir, Vintage, Romantic, Horror
  
  4000 positive examples for each label, for a total of 80,000 images.
  a picture labeled as Sunny is indeed sunny, but it may also be Romantic, for which is not labled. We consider this an unfortunate but acceptable reality of working with large-scale dataset. following ImageNet, we still treat the absence of a label as indication that the image is a negative example for that label.
2. `Wikipaintings`: 85K images for 25 genres. We colllect a dataset of 100,000 high-art images labeeled with artist, style, genre, data, and free-form information. We selected 25 styles with more than 1,000 examples for a total of 85,000 images.
3. `AVA`: Aesthetic Visual Analysis dataset. Annotated with rating by users of DPChallenge, a photographic skill competition website.

### ImageNet Large Scale Visual recognition Chanllenge2015
1. we use the term object recogintion broadly to encompass both image classification as well as object detection(localize all objects present in the image)
2. ILSVRC annotations fall into one of two categories:
  - Image-level annotation of a `binary` label for the presence or absence of an object class in theimage.
  - object-level annotation of a tight bouding box and class label around object instance in the image.
  
  
### LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop
1. While there has been remarkable progress in the perfomance of visual recognition algorithms, the state-of-the-art models tend to be exceptionally `data-hungry`. 
2. Large labeled training datasets, expensive and tedious to produce, are required to opimize millions of parameters in deep network models.
3. Lagging behind the growth in model capacity, the available datasets are quickly becoming outdated in terms of size and density. 
4. To circumvent this bottleneck, we propose to amplify human effort through a partially automated labeling scheme, leveraging deep learning with humans in the loop.
5. Starting  from a large set of candidate images for each category, we iteratively sample a subset, ask people to label them, classify the others with a trained model, split the set into positives, negatives, and unlabeled based on the classification confidence, and then iterate with the unlabeled set.
6. To assess the effective ness of this cascading procedure and enable further progress in visual recoginition research, we construct a new image dataset, LSUN. It contains around one million labeled images for each of 1-scene categorres and 20 object categories. 
7. This paper proposes a working pipeline to acquire large image datasets with category labels using deep learning with humans in the loop.
8. Although the amount of available image data on the Internet is increasing constantly, it is nontrivial to build a superived dataset that dense because of the high costs of manual labeling.
9. In this paper, we introduce an integrated framework using deep learning with humans in the loop to annotate a large-scale image dataset. The key new idea is a labeling propagation system that automatically amplifies manual human effort.

### Multiple verisons of GCC
1. It may be desirable to install multiple versions of the compiler on the same system. This can be done by using different prefix paths at configure time and a few symlinks.
2. Basically, configure the two compiler with different --prefix options, then build and install each compiler.
