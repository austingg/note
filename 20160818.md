# pynetbuilder
1. caffe layers and network is represneted using prototxt format. As we go deeper, and add more layers or build more complex DAG's using basic layers, writing the prototxt files becomes tedious. This tool aims to provide a pythonic interface to generate prototxt file.
2. provides resuable components in from of legos from popular networks
    * inception, resnet, squeezenet
    * app for popular networks for classification and object detection.
    * the complexity modulde computes the number of parameters and connections or flops of the network generated by the app, which suit your memory / runtime needs.

3. pyNetBuilder builds on top of caffe's Netspec to stich together a network. Netspce provides a way to write nets directly in Python, using a natural, functional style. pyNetBuilder is to provide generic warppers to attach blocks of layers to NetSpec in form of Legos.
4. A lego is a basci nerual network building block. 
    * Required parameters - These parameters must be specified while creating a lego, and usually change for each instantiation.
    * Default parameters(which can be overriden). The default parameters can be store and read from a config file. A attach method which attaches a caffe layer to a netspec object.




# C++ 11 random 
1. random_device, random number engine, random number distribution 
``` C++
std:: random_device rd:
std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist(1, 6)
std::norm_int_distribution<> dist(5, 2)

std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(1) << std::setw(2)  
          << p.first << ' ' << std::string(p.second/200, '*') << '\n';

```



In OpenCV 3.0 FAST and ORB have got OCL support and moreover, these two (FAST and ORB) have already got CUDA support.
There is still no GPU accelerated version of KAZE/AKAZE.
