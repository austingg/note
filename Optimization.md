Optimization
============

Optimization plays an increasingly important role in machine learning. For instance, many machine learning algorithms minimize a regularized risk functional.

This chapter provides a self-contained overview of some basic concepts and tools from optimization, especially geared towards solving machine learning problems. In terms of concepts, we will cover topics related to convexity, duality, and Largrange multipliers. In terms of tools, we will cover a variety of optimization algorithms including gradient descent, stochasitc gradient descent, Newton's method, and Quasi-Newton methods. We will also look at some sepcialized alogritms tailored towards solving Linear Programming and Quadratic Programming problems which often arise in machine learning problems.
