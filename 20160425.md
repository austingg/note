# Git Tutorial
1. Version Control systems are a category of softwar tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
2. Version Control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.
3. Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code for a project, app or software component is typecally organized in a folder structures or "file tree". One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in serveral parts of the file tree.
4. Version control heps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping perevent concurrent work from conficting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change can be introduce new bugs on its' own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.
5. If you're a developer who has never used version control you may have added versions to  your files, perhaps with suffixes like "final" or "latest" and then had to later deal with a new final version. Perhaps you've commented out code blocks because you want to disable certain functionality without deleting the code, fearing that there may be a use for it later. Version control is a way out of these problems.
6. While it is possible to develop software without using any version control, doing so subjects the project to a huge risk that no professional team would be advised to accep. So the question is not whether to use version control but which version control system to use.

### What is Git
1. By far, the most widely used modern version control system in world today is Git. Git is mature, actively maintained open source project orignally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.


### Why Git for your organization
1. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. When a developer wants to start working on something ---- no matter how big or small ---- they create a new branch. This ensures that the master branch always contains production-quality code.
2. In SVN, each developer gets a working copy that points back to a single central repository. Git, however, is a distributed version control system. Instead of a working copy, each developer gets their own local respository, complete with a full history of commits. Having a full local history makes Git fast, since it means you don't need a network connection to create commits, inspect previous versions of a file, or perform diffs between commits.
3. A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. This not only makes it easier for project leads to keep track of changes, but also lets developers intiate discussions around their work before integrating it with the rest of the codebase.
4. Encapsulating user interface changes like this makes it easy to present updates to other stakeholders. For example, if the director of engineering wants to see what the design team has been working on, all they have to do is tell the director to check out the corresonding branch.This invites everyboady to participate in the iteration process.

### Basic command
1. However, for most projects, git init only needs to be executed once to create a central repository -- developers typically don't use git init to create theire local repositories. Instead, they'll usually use git clone to copy an existing repository onto their local machine.
2. Like git init, cloning is generally a one-time operation ---- once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations and collaborations are managed through their local repository.
3. Unlike SVN, git makes no distinction between the working copy and the central repository ---- they are all full-fledged Git repositories.Instead of checking a working copy into SVN's central repository, you push or pull commits from one repository to another.
4. git config user.name <name> Define the author name to be used for all commits in the current repository. Typically, you'll want to use the --global flag to set configuration options for the current user.
5. Changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
6. Snapshots are committed to the local repository, and this requires absolutely no interaction with ohter Git repositories.
7. git status:  displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
8. .gitignore file: Any files that you'd like to ignore should be included on a separate line, and the * symbol can be used as a wildcard.
9. git log: displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes. only operates on the committed history.


#Sandbox
In computer security, a sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs. It is often used toe xecuted untested code , or untrusted programs from unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users and untrusted websites.





# DeepScale ---- SquueezeNet new feature
SqueezeNet has 50x fewer weights than AlexNet, but the activations are not particularly small.

Compared to SqueezeNet v1.0, here is what v1.1 provides:
1. smaller activations ( i.e. less memory utilization)
2. less computation per image ( 2.2 less than v1.0)
3. equivalent accuracy


# neon Winograd
After serious perf improvement by NVIDIA's CUDNN R4 across board, I suppose nervana weren't too happy to be left behind. They've just released (as part of Neon) theire Winograd-based kernels which have a non-trivial improvement in performance.

It's really cool that they're still squeezing out performance of this generation of hardware. They seem to have real wins when the network uses 3x3 convolutions.

"Not so fast, FFT" : Winograd
Deep learning thrives on speed. Faster training enables the construction of larger and more complex networks to tackle new domains such as speech or descision making. Recently, small convolutional filter sizes have become an important component in convolutinal neural networks. While most convolutions are computed with the fast fourier transform algorithm, the rising prominence of small 3x3 filter sizes makes the way for lesser known technique specialized for small filter size: Winograd's minimal filter algorithms. 

We have implemented the Winograd algorithm on GPUs and benchmarked performance and convergence on state-of-the-art networks. Depending on the network architecture, training with Nervana's Winograd algorithm yields speed-ups of 2~3 over NVIDIA's cuDNN v4 kernels.
