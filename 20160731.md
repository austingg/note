# Torch nn Convolutional layers
1. A convolution is an integral that express the amount of the overlap of one function g as it is shifed over another function f. It therefore "blends" one function with another.
2. Spatial Modules:
    * SpatialConvolution: 2D convolution over an input image;
    * SpatialFullConvolution: a 2D full convolutional over an input iamge
    * SpatialDilatedConvolution: a 2D dilated convolution over an image.
    * SpatialUpsamplingNearest
    * SpatialUpsampleingBilinear
    * SpatialBatchNormalization
    
    dw, dh: the step of the convolution in the width dimension
    padw, padH, the additional zeros added per width to the input planes. Default is 0, a good number is (kw-1)/2, or (kh-1)/2
