# Class activation maps in Keras
1. a class activation map (CAM) lets us see which regions in the image were relevant to this class. This should be useful for debugging the decision process in classification networks.
2. To be able to create a CAM, the network architecture is restricted to have a global average pooling layer after the final convolutinal layer, and then a linear (densen layer). 
3. Unfortunately this means we can't apply this technique on existing networks that don't have this structure. What we can do is modify existing networks and finetune them to get shi.
4. A global average pooling (GAP) layer just takes each of these 512 channels, and returns their spatial average. 
5. Now to create a heatmap for a class we can just take output images from the last convolution layer, multiply them by their assigned weights (different weights for each class), and sum.
6. Test on person / not person: In this image it's disappointing that the person classifier made a correct decision without even using the face regions at all. Perhaps it should be trained on more images with clear faces.

# path in python
1. PYTHONHOME: Chane the location of the standard Python libraries. By default, the libraries are searched in prefix/lib/python_version_ and exec_prefix/lib/python_version_, where prefix and exec_prefix are installiation-dependent directories, both defaulting to /usr/local
2. PYTHONPATH: Augment the default search path for module files. 
3. site: this module is automatically imported during initialization.


# Python encoding 
``` python
# coding=utf-8

# 字符串前加u会构造出Unicode字符串
unicodeString = u'Unicode字符串'

# 字符串前什么都不加会构造默认编码（首行限定了现在是utf-8），如果没有首行，则默认是Ascii
utf8String = 'Utf-8字符串'

# 转换
unicodeString.encode('utf8')

utf8String.decode('utf8')

# unicode is used for transform between other encodings.

```

decode -> unicode
encode -> binary encoding

identify encoding
python -m pip install chardet

``` python
# coding=utf-8
from chardet import detect
print(detect('这是一串utf-8的测试字符串'))
