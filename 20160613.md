# Linux Command
### pkg-config
1. Return metainformation about installed libraries
  - --cflags
  - --libs
  - --lib-only-L / l
  - --cflags-only-I /
  - --exact-version
2. PKG_CONFIG_PATH
与编程相关的一些环境变量
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
gcc -v
3. uname: print system information 
  - a: print all information
  - s: print the kernel name
  - o: print the operating system
  - p: print the processor type
  
4. make 
   - j: jobs
   
5. python setup.py install --prefix
6. git submodule update --init --recursive 
7. find pathname -options  
   - name
   - perm
   - user
   - group
   - amin n
   - atime
   - cmin
   - mmin
   
8. When you need to search for some files, you might typically use find command. find is a good serach utility but it is slow. However locate can search for file very quickly.
  * locate does not search the files on disk rather it searches for file paths in a database.
  * updatedb. When you execute updatedb, it scans the whole system and updates the mlocate.db database file.
9. whereis : search exe
10. which: search system command in path
11. alias ns=nvidia-smi

### Understanding Symbolic Links
1. Symbolic links are like shortcuts or reference to the actual file or directory. Most of the time these links are transparent when working with them through other programs. An application will still treat it the same.
2. Symbolic links are used all the time to link libraries and make sure files are in consistent places without moving or copying the original. Links are often used to "store" multiple copies of the same file in different places but still reference to one file.
3. The difference Between Soft and Hard Links
  - Hard links 
    * only link to a file not directory
    * Can not reference a file on a different disk or volume
    * Links will reference a file even if it is moved
    * Links reference inode/physical locations on the disk
  - Symbolic(soft) links
    * Can link to directories
    * Can reference a file/folder on a different hard disk/volume
    * Links remain if the original file is deleted
    * Links will not reference the file anymore if it is moved
    * Links reference abstract filenames/directories not physical locations.

### FlickrLogos-32 Dataset
1. the dataset FlickrLogos-32 contains photos showing brand logos and is meant for the evalution of logo retrieval and multi-calss logo detection/recognition systems on real-world images.
2. We collected logos of 32 different logo brands by downloading them from Flickr.


### Manifold Learning
1. Manifold Learning is an apporach to non-linear dimenstionality reduction. Algorithms for this task are based on the idea that the dimensionality of many data sets is only artificially high.
2. High-dimensional datasets can be very difficult to visualize. While data in two or three dimensions can be plotted to show the inherent structure of the data, equivalent high-dimensional plots are much less intuitive. To aid visualization of the sturcture of a dataset, the dimension must be reduced in some way.
