# Fisher-Yates Shuffle
The Fisher-Yates shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite set - in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the set. The alogrithm produces an unbiased permutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them inplace.

-- To shuffle an array of n elements 
for i = n-1 down to 1 do
    j = random interger such that 0 <= j <= i
    exchange a[j] and a[i]
