# Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm
In linear algebra, the Coopersmith - Winograd algorithm, named after Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd, was the asymptotically fastest known matrix multiplication algorithm until 2010. O(n^2.3754777) nxn matrix.
* This is an improvment over the naive O(n^3) time algorithm and the O(n^2.807355) time Strassen algorithm. Algorithms with better asymptotic running time than the Strassen algorithm are rarely used in practice, because the large constant factors in their running times make them impractical.
* 2010 -> O 2.374
* 2011 -> O 2.3728642
* 2014 -> O 2.3728639


#Deep 3D 
1. model link 'http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jxie/download/deep3d-0050.params'
2. pull request 1 more readable.

# SSD: Single shot multibox detection
1. relative complementive programs run it for a try.


### Dump file for debug
1. Youtube video
2. create mini dump file and open it with visual studio, when given the pdb, you can locate the crash line.

# CUDA timeout or window watch dog
1. Ideally, you should be able to break your kernel operations up into multiple passes over your data to break it up into operations that run in the time limit.
2. You can disable the Windows watchdog timer, but that is highly not recommened, for reasons that should be obvious. To disable it, you need to regedit the TDRDelay keys.
3. On Windows, the graphics drivr has a watchdog timer that kills any shader programs that run for more than 5 seconds.
