# Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm
In linear algebra, the Coopersmith - Winograd algorithm, named after Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd, was the asymptotically fastest known matrix multiplication algorithm until 2010. O(n^2.3754777) nxn matrix.
* This is an improvment over the naive O(n^3) time algorithm and the O(n^2.807355) time Strassen algorithm. Algorithms with better asymptotic running time than the Strassen algorithm are rarely used in practice, because the large constant factors in their running times make them impractical.
* 2010 -> O 2.374
* 2011 -> O 2.3728642
* 2014 -> O 2.3728639
