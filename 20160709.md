### Integral Channel Features (ICF)
1. ICF is a method for object detecton in computer vision. It uses integral images to extract features such as local sums, histograms and Haar-like features from multiple registered image channels. This method as highly exploited by Dollar, in his work for pedestrian detection, that was first described at BMVC in 2009.
2. Broader definition in computer vision of channels: a registered map of the original image where the output pixels are mapped to input pixels by some linear or non-transformation. These channels can be used alone or in combination with each other. (image features in earth)


### Object tracking
#### KLT
1. Tracking points in video using Kanada-Lucas-Tomasi(KLT) algorithm. The point tracker object tracks a set of points using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi(KLT), feature-tracking algorithm. You can use the tracker for video stabilizatoin, camera motion estimation and object tracking. It works particularly well for tracking objects that do not change shape and for those theat exhibit visual texture. 
2. The point tracker is often used for short-term tracking as part of a larger tracking framework. As the point tracker algorithm progresses over time, points can be lost due to lighting vairation, out of plane rotation, or articulated motion. To track an object over a long period of time , you may need to reacquire points periodically.
