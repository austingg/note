### Debug VS. Release
When you compile your code in Debug mode, the compiler does a lot fo stuff behind the scenes that prevents many mistakes made by the programmer from crashing the application. When you run in Release, all bets are off. If your code is not correct, you're much more likely to crash in Release than in Debug.

A few things to check:
1. Make sure all variables are properly initialized.
2. Make sure you do not have any deadlocks or race conditions
3. Make sure you aren't passing around pointers to local objects that have been deallocated
4. Make sure your strings are properly NULL_terminated.
5. Related MACRO
MSVC fills unitialized stack data with 0xCC, unitialized heap data with 0xCD and deteled objects with 0xDD

### PDB file
Program Debug DataBase holds debugging and project state information that allows incremental linking of a Debug configuration of your program. A PDB file is created when you compile a c/c++ program with /ZI or /Zi or a Visual Basic/C#/JScript .Net program with debug.

In Visual C++, the /Fd option names the PDB file created by the compiler, When you create a project in Visual Studio using wizards, the /Fd option is set to create a PDB named project.PDB

A PDB file is typically created from source files during compilation. It stores a list of all symbols in a module with their addresses and possibly the name of the file and the line on which the symbol was declared. This symbol information is not stored in the module itself, because it takes up a lot of space.

If you use /Zi or /ZI (C/C++ -> General -> Debug Information Format), then the VC$(PlatformToolsetVersion).pdb is created, which contains the debug info for all of the .obj files created. If alternately you use /Z7, the debug info will be embeded into .obj file, and then embeded into the lib. This si probaly the easiest way to distribute the debug info for a static library.

When you build your final exectable (.exe or .dll) then you'll get a merged pdb form all the little embedded pdbs.  (.lib are just  a set of objs, and debug info is in vcx0.pdb)

To step into the source code, we need the pdb file which containing the source information

If you build your C/C++ appliation using a makefile, and you specify /ZI or /Zi without /Fd, you end up with two PDB files:
1. VCx0.PDB, this file stores all debugging information for the individual OBJ files and resides in the same directory as the project makefile.
2. project.PDB this file stores all debug information for the exe file. For native code, it resides inthe \debug subdirectory.

The linker creates project.PDB, which contains debug information for the project's EXE file. The project.PDB contains full debug information, including function prototypes, not just the type information found in VCx0.PDB. Both PDB files allow incremental updates.

1. Use for debug application.  debug info, symbols
2. Match based on module name and GUID, GUID exist both in module file and PDB file
3. PDB Find Path
    * current directory with exe and dll files
    * Symbol Server Cache
    * Symbol Server 
4. native C++ PDB File content: 
    * public, private and static function address
    * global variable name and address
    * argument and local variable name as well as offset of heap of stack
    * User defined data type: class structure definition
    * source file name and respective lines
    
    
### Debugging with Symbols
This article provides a high level overview of how to best use symbols in your debugging process. It explains how to use the Microsoft symbol server, and also how to set up and use your own private symbol server. These best practices can help increase your effectiveness and ability to debug issues, even in cases where all the symbols and executable files that are related to a problem are not located on your computer.

1. This white paper discusses only VS.Net and the PDB format symbols, because they are the most recent, preferred format. They are generated by default for projects that are the most recent, preferred format. They are generated by default for projects that re compiled by using Visual Studio.
2. Generating PDB files for release executables does not affect any optimizations, or significantly alter the size of the generated files. Typically, the only difference is the path, and the file name of the PDF file is embedded in the executable. For this reason, you **should always** produce PDB files, even if you don't want to ship them with the executable.
3. PDB files are generated if a project is built by using the /Zi or /ZI(produce PDB Information) compiler switch, together with the /DEBUG(Gernate Debug Info) linker switch. The compiler-generated PDB files are combined and written into a single PDB file that is placed in the same directory as the executable. By default, PDB files contain the following information:
    * Public symbols(typically all functions, static and global variables)
    * A list of object files that are responsible for sections of code int he executable
    * Frame pointer optimization information (FPO)
    * Name and type information for local variabels and data structures
    * Source file and line number information
4. If you are concented about perple using the PDB file information to help them reverse engineer your executable, your can also generated stripped PDB files, by using the /PDBSTRIPPED:filename linker option. If you have existing PDB files that you would like to strip private information from, you can use a tool called pdbcopy, which is part of the debugging tools for Windows. By default, stripped PDB files contain the following information:
    * Public symbols (typically only non-static functions and global varibales)
    * A list of object files that are responsible for setctions of code in the exectutable
    * Frame pointer optimization information (FPO)
 This is the minimum information that is required to allow reliable debugging. Minimum information also makes it difficult to obtain any additional information about your original source code. Because both a stripped PDB and a regular PDB file are generated, you can provide the stripped version to users who may need limited debugging abilities, but keep the full PDB confidential. Note that /PDBSTRIPPED generates a second, smaller PDB file, so make sure you use the correct PDB file when you generate builds to distribute broadly. For a typical project, aregular PDB may be a few megabytes in size, but a stripped version of the PDB may be only a few hundred kilobytes.
 5. Symbol Servers: A symbol sever is a repository for multiple versions of executable and symbol files. It contains either the symbol files themselves, or pointer to the associated symbol files.  DLL and exeutable files are also available from the Microsoft symbol server. This makes it possible to debug crashes and examine code for operating system files that may not exist on your machine. You can also set up a private symbol server for  your company, team or network, which can be used to store multiple older versionos of a project your are working on, or to provide a local cache for the symbols that you use from the Microsoft symbol server.
